### Jason is a mailman but he likes to compete in hackathons and make side projects in his spare time.

### However he wastes a lot of time evaluating boilerplates and starter kits arbitrarily.

### This makes Jason a sad mailman.

### Help Jason rate boilerplates.

# Introducing PackageJason
A hackathon/starter kit/boilerplate rating engine. 

- SEARCH: Search open source boilerplates by desired stack (we crawl the dependencies/devDeps for you)
- FAVE: Keep a list of your favorites you can come back to and use
- SCORE: Rapidly evaluate the "cognitive load" of any boilerplate you come across!

### With his new boilerplate skills, Jason even has time to ask Package Jane out on a date!

### Will she accept? Stay tuned!
